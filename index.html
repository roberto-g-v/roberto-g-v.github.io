      <p>When I was little my father bought one of the newly release Compaq computer with Windows 2.0 that had MS-DOS and I can remember really clearly what a mesmerizing feeling of joy it was. I immediately started to play with it and since then I have a close relationship with all kinds of data and computers. In middle-school my IT teacher showed me how to code webpages and have the best memories of it, plus grades couldn’t be better. Moreover, after high-school when it came to choose my profession I couldn’t decide between a “Computer Science Degree” or a “Hospitality Degree”. I ended up choosing Hospitality because my father owns hotels and restaurants. However in college I was really good at subjects like statistics, computing programing and advance excel.
    <p><strong>Looking foward to a promising future</strong></a></p>
        Around the world human beings are creating a symbiosis that deepens the connection between individuals and computers in a very fast pace. We already have a mobile device and internet that allow us to connect within seconds. As an MBA candidate 2020 on “Data Analytics I have the perfect opportunity to study all the data inside the environment of computer science and analyze how it affects as an end product to society.
    <p><strong>Joining the dots</strong></a></p>
        Looking back at my life, now I can join the dots that brought me until this very precise moment of shifting my attention and career into something that I love “Data Analytics”. Looking forward I see a bright future with rapid technology shifts holding our progress. As my favorite writer Isaac Asimov once said “If my doctor told me I had only six minutes to live, I wouldn't brood. I'd type a little faster.” I would say to any employer reading this - let’s begin typing, coding and programming faster than Speedy Gonzalez.
